Build a Fully Functional & Modern Java Swing Desktop App — CineBook CDO 🎬
You are tasked with developing CineBook CDO, a modern Java Swing-based desktop application that simulates an online cinema ticket booking system for users in Cagayan de Oro (CDO), Philippines.

The application should have a professional-looking GUI using Java Swing, simulate real-world booking operations, and store data using arrays or ArrayLists for simplicity—suitable for a first-year college student.

🧩 Scope Summary
This is a fully functional prototype, built with a modern user interface, implementing both User and Admin features, and following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for structure.

🧱 Technologies & Tools
Component	Stack
Language	Java (JDK 8 or higher)
GUI	Java Swing
Data Storage	Arrays / ArrayLists
Build Tool	Manual (via javac) or simple scripts
IDE	VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
Extras	Dialogs & Console Logs for simulation

🎨 UI Requirements — Modern Design
Use consistent fonts and spacing

Incorporate images/icons from the /assets folder

Apply custom colors for buttons (e.g., blue for primary, gray for disabled)

Use CardLayout or JTabbedPane for switching between panels

Responsive layout within reason (centered forms, resizable dialogs)

Splash screen with a logo and loading bar (optional)

🧠 Core Functionalities
👤 User Side:
 Create account or checkout as guest

 View current movies in 3 cinemas (with filtering)

 Select schedule, seats (Standard/Deluxe), and concessions

 Limit of 6 seats per booking

 Add snacks (Popcorn, Drinks)

 Choose a payment method (GCash, PayMaya, Credit Card) — Simulated

 Show ticket summary (simulate email or SMS confirmation via console popup)

 E-ticket panel with seat info and confirmation number

🔐 Admin Side:
 Login using hardcoded admin credentials

 Add/edit/delete movie schedules

 Manage seat availability

 View user booking logs

 Simulate exporting reports to .txt (optional)

 Show total sales summary (basic simulation)

💡 Data Simulation Using Arrays
All data is stored in memory only, using arrays or ArrayList:

java
Copy
Edit
ArrayList<Movie> movies = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<User> users = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<Booking> bookings = new ArrayList<>();
No database required. Populate sample data at runtime when launching the app.

🔐 Admin Login (Sample)
java
Copy

Username: admin
Password: admin123
